## Project Description:

The Unity3D End-Effector Control project focuses on the integration and control of various types of end-effectors, including Robotiq, OnRobot, ABB Smart Gripper, and SMC's custom grippers,within the Unity3D environment. This project leverages the power of Unity3D, a robust game development engine, to provide a versatile and user-friendly platform for simulating, testing, and controlling a variety of robotic end-effectors.

The repository that describes the design of SMC's custom grippers, and other useful information can be found in the link below.

**RG2 Parameters:**

- v = 55 to 180 mm/s
- total_stroke = 0.0 (0.0 rad.) to 100 mm (1.2026191210860813 rad.)


**Robotiq 2F-85:**

- v = 20 to 150 mm/s
- total_stroke = 0.0 (0.0 rad.) to 85 (0.8014900991005511 rad.) mm

**ABB Smart Gripper:**

- v = 5 to 25 mm/s
- total_stroke = 0.0 to 50 mm
